# Abstract

*The problem: miscreants are modifying ZIP file header parts so, that some automated analysis tools are unable to process the contents but intended clients are able to open the files and extract the possibly malicious contents. This paper points out possible negative impact of different behaviour of client implementations and proposes some solutions to address this issue.*
